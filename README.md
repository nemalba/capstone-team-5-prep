# Practice with flexbox properties

This is a collection of exercises to practice working with flexbox containers and flex item properties. These are some of the same exercises that you have done before.

## Before you begin

The purspose of this exercise is not to have you individually complete each of the exercises, rather it is to have you learn how to split the work into separate tasks that are to be completed by separate team members.

There are 8 individual tasks. Each team member should be assigned 1 specific tasks to complete. The remaining tasks should be used to demonstrate and practice resolving merge conflicts.
